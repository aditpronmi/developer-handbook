Medical-surgical nursing is a branch of nursing that focuses on providing care for adult patients with various medical and surgical conditions. Medical-surgical nurses use critical thinking and evidence-based practice to deliver person-centred care that promotes health, prevents complications, and supports recovery.

Medical-surgical nursing is not only a specialty practice area, but also a core competency for all nurses. Medical-surgical nurses work in various settings, such as hospitals, clinics, ambulatory care centers, home health agencies, and long-term care facilities. They care for patients with diverse diagnoses and complex needs, such as diabetes, heart failure, stroke, cancer, and trauma. They also collaborate with other health care professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, physical therapists, and social workers, to provide holistic and coordinated care.
 
The scope of medical-surgical nursing[^4^] is to promote health and prevent illness or injury in patients from 18 to older than 100 years of age. A separate chapter on care of older adults is part of this textbook because the majority of medical-surgical patients are older than 65 years. Medical-surgical nursing also encompasses the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems, as well as the evaluation of outcomes from those interventions. The goal of medical-surgical nursing is to assist patients in promoting, restoring, or maintaining optimal health.
 
To practice medical-surgical nursing effectively, nurses need to have a solid foundation of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and judgment. They also need to adhere to the professional standards and ethical principles that guide their practice.

The Scope and Standards of Medical-Surgical Nursing Practice[^2^] provide more specific details about the competencies and performance indicators for medical-surgical nurses.
